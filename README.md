## Hello! ##

I'm Zachary, a programmer who does a lot of Emacs, Lisp, generative art, Arduino, and Forth.

You might find a lot more at [my website](https://zck.org/).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Forth that runs on Arduino.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to run NixOS and create Nix projects.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have an [IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9125111/).
